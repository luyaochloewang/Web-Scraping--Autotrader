# AutoTrader Car Data Scraper
# Final Project -- Qihan Guan, Michael Harris, Luyao Wang
----------------------------------------


# Overview
-----------------------------------------
There are two source code copies, '422 Final Project Autotrader-Search1.ipynb'
and '422 Final Project Autotrader-Search2.ipynb'. The two source code copies
are identical except that they scrape different cars. We put two source code
copies here to demonstrate that our user input function is working, and our
program can take different user inputs to conduct different scraping tasks.

The first file scrapes all 2019-2020 Toyota Camry's within 50 miles of zipcode 
94523. The second file scrapes all 2017-2021 BMW 530i's within 50 miles of 
zipcode 90001. The scraped data are saved in a MongoDB database with 
user-input-specific names. The DB dump files are in the '\DB Dumps' folder.
